# voxDemo

The notebooks here can be opened with iPython or Jupyter (install either with
conda). CD to the directory with the notebook, and type "jupyter notebook".
The directory will open in your browser, and clicking on the notebook file
will open it in a new tab, where you can edit it with text sections and
code sections. Most of it should already have run on my computer and the
results should still be there. If you want to rerun things, you'll have to
make sure all packages (scikit-learn, matplotlib, etc.) are installed on your
machine (which you'll likely need to do anyway), and adjust local things
like pathnames and whatnot.

If you're comfortable with the iPython interface, feel free to use it.
Otherwise, pick your favorite IDE, write all the code you need to there,
run it from your terminal, etc. Whatever you like. We'll ask for your code
at the end of the assignment along with your writeup. We care that your code
is your own (or appropriately citing anything borrowed), and correct, but
beyond that the specifics are up to you.

Everything in this demo is just examples of how to do some basic things.
The Scikit learn website will be a very helpful resource for finding out
how to implement these algorithms simply and quickly. (Stack Exchange and
Google too.) Let us/Piazza know if you get stuck, though.
